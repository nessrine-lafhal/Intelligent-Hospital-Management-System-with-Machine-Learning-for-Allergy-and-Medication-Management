# Project 1: Medical Diagnosis Prediction System
Objective: Develop a system to predict potential medical diagnoses for patients based on their
symptoms and medical history. This system aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support
clinical decision-making by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.
Tables Used:
- `patient_medicalhistory`: Contains records of patient medical histories, including past
conditions and treatments.
- `diagnosis_master`: Stores a list of possible diagnoses and their descriptions.
- `patient_add`: Holds basic patient information such as name, age, and medical details.
- `consultation_reg`: Documents patient consultations and interactions with healthcare providers.
Approach:
● Data Collection and Preparation: Gather and preprocess data from the aforementioned
tables to create a comprehensive dataset. This involves handling missing values,
normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.
● Model Training:
- Model Selection:Train over 5 different models, including various classification
algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting
Machines (GBM), and Neural Networks.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assess the models based on performance metrics like accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps in determining the most effective model for
predicting diagnoses.
● Model Integration:
- Choosing the Best Model: After evaluating the models, the RandomForest model
emerged as the most performant based on its high accuracy and reliability.
- Model Saving:Save the trained RandomForest model in a serialized format (.pkl for
Python or .php for PHP) to ensure ease of use and integration into a web application.
● Implementation in PHP:
- Integration: Implement the saved model into a PHP-based prediction page. This involves
creating a PHP script that loads the model and performs predictions based on user inputs.
- User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for entering patient symptoms and
medical history, which feeds into the prediction system to generate potential diagnoses.
● Future Enhancements:
- NLP Integration:Consider incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract
relevant information from unstructured medical notes and improve prediction accuracy.
- Model Updates: Periodically retrain the model with new data to ensure its predictions
remain accurate and up-to-date.
By combining advanced machine learning techniques and robust model evaluation, this system
aims to provide reliable diagnostic predictions and support healthcare professionals in their
decision-making process
